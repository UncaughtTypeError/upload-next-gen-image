## Frequently Asked Questions

### How can I convert images to .avif or .webp?

Use [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/ 'Squoosh'). It is an online application that allows you to quickly upload and covert images in your browser.

### What browsers are compatible with .avif, .webp, .svg?

- .avif: [caniuse.com/avif](https://caniuse.com/avif 'Can I use avif?')
- .webp: [caniuse.com/webp](https://caniuse.com/webp 'Can I use webp?')
- .svg: [caniuse.com/svg-img](https://caniuse.com/svg-img 'Can I use svg?')

### How do I support older browsers?

**Give them a fallback.**

Use the `<picture>` element to do this, see [The Picture element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture 'The Picture element - MDN')

**Example:**

    <picture>
        <source srcset="/wp-content/uploads/img.avif" type="image/avif">
        <source srcset="/wp-content/uploads/img.webp" type="image/webp">
        <img src="/wp-content/uploads/img.jpg" alt="The fallback image">
    </picture>

The browser will try the images above in the order you place them.
If .avif is not supported, the browser will check the next `<source>`, which is .webp.
If no images in any or the `<source>` elements can be loaded or supported the browser will default to the `<img>` element and load whatever image is specified.
The fallback image format specified in the last `<img>` element should be a cross-browser supported format, e.g. .png, .jpg, .gif.
